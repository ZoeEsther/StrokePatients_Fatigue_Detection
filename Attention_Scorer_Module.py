            (default is 0.2 -> 20% of 1 minute)

        ear_time_threshold: float or int

            (default is 35 degrees from the center position)

        yaw_threshold: int
            threshold of the yaw angle for considering the person distracted/unconscious (not straight neck)
            (default is 30 degrees from the straight neck position)

        roll_threshold: int
            threshold of the roll angle for considering the person distracted/unconscious (not straight neck)

        The 3 if blocks that follow are written in a way that when we have a score that's over it's value threshold, 
        a respective score counter (ear counter, gaze counter, pose counter) is increased and can reach a given maximum 
        over time.
        When a score doesn't surpass a threshold, it is diminished and can go to a minimum of zero.
        
        Example:
        
        If the ear score of the eye of the driver surpasses the threshold for a SINGLE frame, the ear_counter is increased.
        If the ear score of the eye is surpassed for multiple frames, the ear_counter will be increased and will reach 
        a given maximum, then it won't increase but the "asleep" variable will be set to True.
        When the ear_score doesn't surpass the threshold, the ear_counter is decreased. If there are multiple frame
        where the score doesn't surpass the threshold, the ear_counter can reach the minimum of zero
        
        This way, we have a cumulative score for each of the controlled features (EAR, GAZE and HEAD POSE).
        If high score it's reached for a cumulative counter, this function will retain its value and will need a
        bit of "cool-down time" to reach zero again
